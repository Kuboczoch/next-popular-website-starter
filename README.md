This template repo serves as a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) starter for anyone who is
looking to get up and running with Next.js and TypeScript fast.
It started with an idea for having a template to gather all collected knowledge
about best practise and large code management within next.js project.

## Why should I use this template?

There are tones of ways to create a website, but in fact every website starts from somewhere and
your work and time that you gave to achieve the fundamental structure is sometimes more than full week of work.

You can avoid it using this template!

This template contains all the required things that you are going to write anyway.
You want a custom header that is at the top of your website? Sure we have it!
Want some other standard element? We have it too!

Even more! For example this template provides you the common element like **Button** that you could write on your own,
but it will take you some time, and you only wanted to have a custom looking button on your website.
With this template if you want a custom looking button you can just
add your `variant` to the `Button/variants` and :tada: everything works perfectly!
Loaders, next links, icons everything is already provided!

Our best way to create **ANY** website from scratch is to use this template, just follow our path
and you can easily write any website without any pain!

## Quick start

* Using GitHub.
  Use the green button at the top of the repo: "Use this template" to create your repo.
  If you have any questions then [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)
  is a link to the official guide.

* Using CLI.
  To create a project with this template using CLI, open your terminal,
  cd into the directory you’d like to create the app in, and run the following command:

```cli
npx create-next-app nextjs-blog --use-yarn --example "https://github.com/Kuboczoch/next-popular-website-starter"
```

* Primitive way.
  Download this repo and change .git configuration.
