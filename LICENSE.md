The Cool License is a cool license. It was created by Kuboczoch with help of Starchasers community and is given to you freely as a gift.
You may use, modify, redistribute, and generally hack it about in any way you like, and you do not have to give us anything in return.

However, if you are using this product commercially you are forced to write a thank you to the product owner.
This could be by writing an add-on package, providing a useful bug report, making an improvement to the code, or perhaps just writing a thank-you email to the owner email address.
If you redistribute parts of this code, it would be nice if you mentioned us somewhere in the credits, but you are not required to do this.
We trust you not to abuse our generosity.
